            type: number
            description: Values from the average column and interpolated values where data are missing. Interpolated values are computed in two steps. First, we compute for each month the average seasonal cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value. In this way the seasonal cycle is allowed to change slowly over time. We then determine the trend value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in the trend column. Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months. The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle value and the trend value for the missing month.

Each year has a different uncertainty. Please see Conway et al., 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a complete discussion. The last one or two years listed could have preliminary uncertainties set equal to the average uncertainty since 1980. Before 1980 the global growth rate has been approximated by taking the average of Mauna Loa and the South Pole, correcting for the offset between (MLO+SPO)/2 and the global Marine Boundary Layer, as described in Ballantyne et al, 2012.

CO2 PPM - Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide. Data are sourced from the US Government's Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division. Two main series are provided: the Mauna Loa series (which has the longest continuous series since 1958) and a Global Average series (a global average over marine surface sites).

## Data

### Description

> Data are reported as a dry air mole fraction defined as the number of molecules of carbon dioxide divided by the number of all molecules in air, including CO2 itself, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as parts per million (ppm). Example: 0.000400 is expressed as 400 ppm.[*][ccgg-trends]
